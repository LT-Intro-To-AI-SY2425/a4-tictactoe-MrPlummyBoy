# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
    Knowing if they had won
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
    Call a method that decides where to play
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
    I am not totally sure i would maybe think of some use of AI but i am not entirely sure if that would work.
